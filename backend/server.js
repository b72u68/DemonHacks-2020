        "6.	Allow your tailbone to point straight down toward the ground and maintain length along your spine.",
        "7.	Hold the pose for five full, deep breaths. To come out of the pose, straighten your legs on an inhale, and bring your arms to your sides on an exhale; alternately, use an exhale to fold forward into Uttanasana for a more passive exit.",
